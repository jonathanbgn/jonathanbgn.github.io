![Me](/assets/images/me.jpg){:style="width: 33%; margin-left: 20px; float: right"}

I am a **machine learning engineer** with 10+ years of programming experience. My focus is mainly on **natural language processing** (NLP), text/speech classification, sentiment analysis, emotion recognition, language generation, language models, transfer learning.

I learned programming when I was 12, building web apps and video games. I went on to study Computer Science at [INSA Lyon](https://www.insa-lyon.fr) in France and [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) in Beijing. While at school, I co-founded [City Domination](https://www.citydomination.games), one of the first mobile games taking advantage of geo-localization on smartphones (before Ingress or Pokemon Go). The game got acquired and is still running strong today, with 1 million players in 170 countries.

After graduating, I took an interest in the business side of tech products. I first became a product manager at private cloud provider [Synology](https://www.synology.com) and then a brand strategy consultant at [RedPeak](https://www.red-peak.com), working with large tech multinationals and startups in the Artificial Intelligence, smartphone, PC, IoT, and semiconductors industries.

Two years ago, after working on many exciting AI projects with my consulting clients, I decided to jump back to the technical and machine learning side of things. I am a big believer in continuous learning by doing, so I built [multiple projects and prototypes](/projects.html) as I explored new possibilities enabled by the latest research in the field. I chose to focus on natural language processing and speech as I have always been fascinated by languages, having studied and worked in Spain, Argentina, China, and Taiwan.

As someone with an understanding of both tech and business sides, I am particularly interested in concrete business applications for AI. On this blog, you can find some of my thoughts and projects in this space. I hope you will enjoy your visit!

**I'm currently open to opportunities in machine learning or natural language processing.**
