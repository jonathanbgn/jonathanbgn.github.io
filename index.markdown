## Hello!

I am a French software engineer who also worked as a brand strategy consultant for the past 2 and a half years. Currently taking a gap year to experiment with the latest research in machine learning, I'm particularly interested about natural language processing and concrete business applications for AI.

I recently launched [BrandImage.io](https://www.brandimage.io/), a 100% free social media listening tool for companies to better understand how people perceive them and their products. In today's digital world, brands need to pay increased attention to consumer opinion to stay relevant. Machine learning and more specifically NLP can help companies improve with structured, constructive feedback. BrandImage.io leverages some of the latest models from research like Google AI's BERT for language understanding to analyze and interpret consumer's points of view.

**I'm currently open to opportunities in machine learning or natural language processing.**

You can reach me by [email](mailto:{{site.email}}) or on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathan-boigne/).
