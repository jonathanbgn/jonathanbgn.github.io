A fun website generating artificial “inspirational” quotes using OpenAI’s popular GPT-2 model. I fine-tuned the language model on hundreds of thousands of quotes from famous authors, artists, and philosophers. The model’s generation is filtered to include only quotes that don’t exist already out there.
